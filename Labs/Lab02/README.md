## Mandatory Screenshot and Autograding Rules

Read these rules before starting. The automated grader awards marks separately for each required screenshot.

1. Before doing this lab, use an Ubuntu account whose terminal prompt shows your registered GitHub username before `@` and `ubuntu` as the hostname:

   ```text
   YourGitHubUsername@ubuntu:~$
   ```

   The comparison is case-insensitive, but spelling must match the `user_name` registered in the Student Marks Portal.

2. Every screenshot must clearly show:
   - `YourGitHubUsername@ubuntu` in the terminal prompt;
   - the command or GitHub operation required by that task; and
   - the relevant result or output.

3. For GitHub web-interface tasks, use a split-screen view so the GitHub page and a terminal showing `YourGitHubUsername@ubuntu` are visible in the same screenshot.

4. Save every screenshot inside:

   ```text
   Labs/Lab02/screenshots/
   ```

5. Use the exact filename and capitalization given in this document. Do not rename files, add numbers, or use alternative spellings.

6. Screenshots must be readable by OCR. A missing, unclear, cropped, or unreadable screenshot receives zero for that check.

7. The required command and its relevant output must be visible. A screenshot containing only the command or only unrelated output may receive zero.

8. Exact and visually near-duplicate screenshots are compared across students for the same task. If two students submit the same or slightly modified screenshot, both receive zero for that task.

9. Do not expose passwords, private SSH keys, access tokens, recovery codes, or other secrets. It is acceptable to show a public-key entry or fingerprint without revealing private key contents.

10. Commit and push the complete `Labs/Lab02` directory to `DevOps` before the deadline. Files remaining only on your computer cannot be graded.

### Required Automated-Grading Filenames

The current Lab 2 grader checks these 37 files:

```text
git_installation.png
repo_private.png
ssh_keygen.png
github_sshkey.png
ssh_clone.png
git_identity.png
git_config_list.png
git_folder.png

   ```
   - Save it as `Labs/Lab02/screenshots/ssh_clone.png`.

---

## Task 3: Configure Git Username and Email

1. **Set up your Git identity (this ensures all commits are linked to you):**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   - Save a screenshot of your terminal as `git_identity.png`.

2. **Verify your configuration:**

   ```
   - Screenshot as `git_config_list.png`.

---

## Task 4: Explore the .git Folder

1. Navigate into your cloned repository folder.
2. Show hidden files and locate the `.git` directory.
3. Explore what’s inside using:
   ```bash
   ls -a .git
   ```
   - Take a screenshot as `git_folder.png`.

4. Note: This folder contains history, logs, and config for your repository. Do **not** modify these files manually.

---

## Task 5: Local Repository Management

1. **Delete the existing `.git` folder from your cloned repo using Git Bash:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .git
   git status ==> error why?
   ```
   - Take a screenshot as `delete_git.png`.
2. **Re-initialize the local git repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `git_init.png`.
3. **Add a file named `README.md` and commit it:**
   ```bash
   echo "# Lab02 Git Practice" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `first_commit.png`.
4. **Connect your local repo to GitHub and push:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:<yourusername>/DevOps_Lab2_Practice.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - Save a screenshot as `first_push.png`.

---

## Task 6: File Status & Staging

1. Create a new file `notes.txt` and write a note.
   ```bash
   echo "Adding some test notes" >> notes.txt
   ```
2. Check status:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - Screenshot as `status1.png`.
3. Stage and commit:
   ```bash
   git add notes.txt
   git commit -m "Add notes.txt"
   ```
   - Screenshot as `commit_notes.png`.
4. Edit `notes.txt` and repeat status/commit steps.

---

## Task 7: Branch Creation Using GitHub GUI

1. **On GitHub (web interface), create a branch named `bugfix/user-auth-error`.**
2. **Pull the branch to your local repository to sync.**
   ```bash
   git pull origin bugfix/user-auth-error
   ```
   - Take a screenshot of branch creation in the GUI as `bugfix_branch_gui.png`.
   - Take a screenshot of your local git branch list after pulling as `bugfix_branch_local.png`.

---

## Task 8: Branch Creation and Push Using Git Bash

1. **Create a branch named `feature/db-connection` using Git Bash:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/db-connection
   ```
2. **Push the branch to the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/db-connection
   ```
   - Take a screenshot of the branch creation and push as `feature_db_branch.png`.

---

## Task 9: Branching & Merging

1. Create and switch to a branch `feature-1`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-1
   ```
   - Screenshot as `branch_create.png`.
2. Modify `main.py` (add a function) and commit.
   ```bash
   git add main.py
   git commit -m "Add new function to main.py"
   ```
   - Screenshot as `feature_commit.png`.
3. Switch back to `main` and merge: 
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-1
   ```
   - Screenshot as `merge.png`.

    Merging directly into `main` from your local terminal is **widely considered a risky anti-pattern**, especially on a team. In professional software development, using a **Pull Request (PR)** or **Merge Request (MR)** is the **gold standard**.

4. Push all branches:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   git push origin feature-1
   ```
   - Screenshot as `push_branches.png`.

---

## Task 10: Pull Request and Branch Review (GitHub GUI)

1. **On GitHub, create a Pull Request from the branch `feature/db-connection` to `main`.**
2. **Review the Pull Request and merge it using the GitHub GUI.**
3. **After merging, delete the `feature/db-connection` branch using the GitHub GUI.**
   - Take a screenshot of:
     - The Pull Request creation (`pr_creation.png`)
     - The Pull Request review and merge (`pr_merge.png`)
     - The branch deletion (`branch_delete.png`)

---

## Task 11: Detailed Branch Strategy (Develop/Staging)

1. Create the following branches to simulate a professional branching strategy:
   - `develop`
   - `staging`
   - `feature/*`
   - `bugfix/*`

2. Example workflow:
   - Developers work on `feature/*` and `bugfix/*` branches.
   - Merge into `develop` after completion.
   - `develop` is merged into `staging` for testing.
   - Finally, `staging` is merged into `main` (production).

3. Document the workflow with screenshots:
   - Branch list (`branch_strategy.png`)
   - Merges into `develop` and `staging` (`branch_merges.png`)
   - Final merge into `main` (`final_merge.png`)

---

## Task 12: Code Review Workflow

1. **Create a Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR):**
   - From a feature branch into `main`.
   - Add a clear title and description summarizing the changes.
   - Screenshot as `pr_create_details.png`.

2. **Assign a reviewer** (teammate or second account).  
   - Screenshot as `pr_assigned_reviewer.png`.

3. **Reviewer Actions (capture screenshots for each):**
   - Request changes and add comments → `pr_request_changes.png`
   - Reject or close a practice PR → `pr_rejected.png`. Use a separate practice PR if necessary so all required review states can be demonstrated safely.

4. **Author Actions:**
   - Fix issues in the same branch and push new commits.  
   - PR updates automatically.  
   - Screenshot updated PR with new commits → `pr_updated_with_commits.png`.

5. **Merge the PR:**
   - Reviewer approves → merge using GitHub/GitLab UI.  
   - Choose merge style (merge commit, squash, or rebase).  
   - Screenshot confirmation → `pr_merge_confirm.png`.  
   - Screenshot result → `pr_merged.png`.

6. **Branch Handling After Merge:**
   - Delete the merged PR branch and save the evidence as `pr_branch_deleted.png`.

---

## Task 13: Branch Cleanup Best Practices

1. **Delete Remote Branch After Merge:**
   - Delete a merged branch through the GitHub UI and save the evidence as `remote_branch_deleted.png`.
   - Delete another completed remote branch from the terminal:

     ```bash
     git push origin --delete <branch-name>
     ```

   - Save the terminal evidence as `remote_branch_delete_cmd.png`.

2. **Update Local Repository:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -d <branch-name>
   git branch
   ```

3. Save the GitHub branch-deletion evidence as `remote_branch_deleted.png`.
4. Save the terminal command used to delete a remote branch as `remote_branch_delete_cmd.png`.

---

## Bonus Task: Simulated Team Collaboration

1. Create a branch `collab`.
2. Add a collaborator on your GitHub repository.
3. Both users should pull the latest changes, add their name and a fun fact to `notes.txt`, commit, and push to `collab`.
4. Save the collaboration evidence as `collab_commit.png`.
5. Merge `collab` into `main` and push:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge collab
   git push origin main
   ```

6. Save the merge evidence as `collab_merge.png`.

The bonus screenshots are not included in the 37 mandatory automated checks.
